Literate
--------

This book is actually a literate program. The examples are self-standing,
complete and can be untangled from the code-base.

Each section defines it's own namespace. In most cases (not including here)
the namespace declaration appears in a preamble to each section without
further discussion, unless this declaration raises some issue itself. For
other code snippets, each one (may) depend on the previous one in the same
section. If code from other sections is required that will be made clear by
the declarations in namespace form.

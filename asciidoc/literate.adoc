Literate
--------

This book is actually a literate program. The examples are self-standing,
complete and can be untangled from the code-base. This has the significant
advantage that all of the code examples in this book are complete and can be
evaluated directly; consider this minimal ontology below.

(ns take.wing.literate
  (:use [tawny.owl]))

(defontology o)

(defclass A)
(defclass B)
(defoproperty r)

(defclass C
  :super A (owl-some r B))

This comes at a slight cost; the code samples *must* be complete. So, some
code is repeated between different namespaces. In this document, each section
defines it's own namespace. In most cases (not including here) the namespace
declaration appears in a preamble to each section without further discussion,
unless this declaration raises some issue itself. For other code snippets,
each one (may) depend on the previous one in the same section. If code from
other sections is required that will be made clear by the declarations in
namespace form.

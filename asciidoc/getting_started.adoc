Getting Started
---------------

In this section, we will build a (very basic) ontology and start to show the
basic capabilities of Tawny-OWL. The first step is to define a new project,
for which we will use Leiningen.

As described in <<_the_environment,the environment>>, Tawny-OWL can be used
with several different toolchains; the instructions given here are reasonably
generic rather than biased toward a single environment. There are often more
efficient ways to achieve the tasks here with tool support. Initially, we will
point out some alternative ways of achieving these task; this will be dropped
as get further into the book to avoid cluttering the text with too many
alternatives.


Getting a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will start this book by creating a Pizza ontology; we choose pizzas because
they are simple, well-understood and compositional (see
http://robertdavidstevens.wordpress.com/2010/01/22/why-the-pizza-ontology-tutorial/[here]
for more). For this book, we will use a pre-rolled project -- in fact the one
used to create this book. You can access the project data from
https://github.com/phillord/take-wing[github], either using `git` or through
the download option. If you wish to know how to build a project yourself,
please read <<new_project,the appendix>>.

A leiningen project is, essentially, a directory structure with a project
file. The `project.clj` file for this book looks like this:

[source,qclojure]
----
include::../project.clj[]
----

This includes three critical pieces of information. Firstly `take-wing` which
is the name of the project. Secondly, immediately after this is a version
number such as `0.1.0`. Finally, we have a `:dependencies` which includes only
a single dependency to `tawny-owl` itself.


Defining a new namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,clojure]
----
(ns take.wing.getting-started
    (:use [tawny.owl]))
----


//
// Local Variables:
// linked-buffer-init: linked-buffer-wing-init
// End:

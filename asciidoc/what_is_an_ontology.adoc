What is an Ontology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ontologies are about definitions. It is, perhaps, unsurprising therefore that
amount ontologists there are quite a few debates about what exactly an
ontology is and is not; it is not our intention here to either cover these
arguments, nor to give a comprehensive overview of all the uses of the word.

What is generally agreed is that ontologies describe a set of entities, in
terms of the relationships between these entities, using any of a number of
different relationships. So, for example, we can describe entities in terms of
their class relationships -- what is true of a superclass is also true of all
subclasses. Or we can describe the _partonomic_ relationships: the finger is
part of the hand, which is part of the foot.

An ontology is also very similar to a taxonomy; however, ontologies place much
greater emphasis on their computational properties. This makes ontologies much
more suitable for driving applications and code, although this often comes at
the cost of human understandability of the ontology. In this document, all the
ontologies we talk about are represented using specific language, called OWL
(the Ontology Web Language). This has very well-defined computational
properties, and through the document we will explore the implications of these
properties.

We also use the term "ontology" to mean a specific object that you can
manipulate in Tawny-OWL -- similar to the way we say that you are reading some
words now.

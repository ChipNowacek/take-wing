Appendix: Creating a new project
--------------------------------
[[new_project]]


Creating a new project is simple and straight-forward.` If you are using the
command line, first need to install http://www.leiningen.org[Leiningen]; if
you are using Eclipse or something similar, it may already have leiningen
built in. Now, we create a new project which we will call `take-wing`.

[source,sh]
----
lein new take-wing
----

This will create a new directory called `take-wing` and a number of files. The
only critical one at the moment is called `project.clj`.

[source,qclojure]
----
(defproject take-wing "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]])
----

This is a project definition written in Clojure. We need to modify this to
work with the current version of Tawny-OWL.

[source,qclojure]
----
(defproject take-wing "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
                 [uk.org.russet/tawny-owl "1.1"]])
----

You can now test the project with `lein deps` which should give download
messages or `lein repl` which will start a REPL.

== How This Book is Written

This book has been written in asciidoc with a large number of code examples.
It is actually somewhat more than this; it is also a literate programme. The
code examples can be "untangled" from the documentation and directly run.

The book is structured as a Leiningen project, with the +src+, and +test+
directory. However, the +src+ directory is empty in the repository. The
Clojure source for this project is autogenerated from the asciidoc source.

Untangling is performed using
http://github.com/phillord/linked-buffer[linked-buffer] which is an Emacs
package which allows the author to edit the text in either asciidoc or Clojure
source form depending on which is most useful at any point in time. Custom
support for this untangling is found in the +emacs+ directory. To perform this 
Tests are stored in the +test+ directory and can be run using `lein run`, but
require that the source has been untangled.
